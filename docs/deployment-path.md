# 📝 Planned Deployment Path (Backend Only)

## 1. Code Development & Testing
- Develop features in Spring Boot / Spring Batch.
- Test locally using JUnit, Mockito, and Postman.
- Use H2 database for unit testing or SQL Server for integration testing.

## 2. Build & Package
- Use Maven to compile the project and create a runnable JAR.

## 3. Containerization
- Create a Docker image of the application.
- Optionally, use Docker Compose if you want to include a database container for demo purposes.

## 4.Deployment
- Run the Docker container locally, or push the image to a remote container registry 
(like Docker Hub) for easy sharing/demo.
- The backend runs inside the container with exposed ports.

## 5.Demo / Interaction
- Swagger UI serves interactive API documentation inside the container.
- Postman can also be used to interact with the API remotely.

## Optional CI/CD
- GitHub Actions can automate build → test → Docker image creation → deployment steps.
