# 📌 Project Purpose

---
## 🏗️ Why I am making this project?
I'm building this project to:
- Familiarize myself with Spring Boot and its overall development lifecycle.
- Gradually master Spring Boot, even if I’m not yet sure when I’ll fully get there but what matters is that 
I’m continuously developing myself in the backend field, one step at a time.
- Learn how to use Spring Batch, especially in processing raw data (e.g., Excel, CSV) into databases or API endpoints.
- Understand data processing design decisions, particularly how to send processed data not only to 
databases but also as API responses.
- Explore advanced backend features such as pagination, rate limiting, and idempotency.
- Practice implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization.
- Get hands-on experience with Docker and Docker Compose, especially in containerizing and deploying applications.
- Experiment with deployment using Docker.
- Create a reusable reference project for solving future business problems that involve batch data processing with Spring Batch.

## 👷‍♂️ Who is this project for?
This project is for:
- My professional growth as a backend developer.
- Improving my knowledge and skills in software development, especially in handling errors and debugging efficiently.
- Building confidence in my abilities, proving to myself that I can create reliable and scalable backend systems.
- Strengthening my consistency and determination to keep learning and improving, no matter the challenges.

## 🧐 What is going to make it valuable?
- This project will be valuable for my future work and projects, especially if I get hired in a 
backend development role.
- It serves as a practical reference for data processing, showcasing how Spring Batch can transform, 
format, and deliver raw data to databases or API endpoints.
- It acts as a portfolio project that demonstrates my ability to handle end-to-end backend development 
from data ingestion and processing to deployment.
