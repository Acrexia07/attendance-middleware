### Day 2: Preparation for JWT Implementation
**📅 Date:** October 21, 2025

**🎯 Objectives:**
- Create `JwtService` to implement JWT.
- Add customize exception and user details service

**📝 Implementation Summary:**
- Created `JwtService` to implement JWT.
- Added customize exception and user details service.
- Redefine all my project plans and separate them by `md files`.
- Update entity and attributes from data folder after refining my project plans

**💭 My thought process:** I will continue to add JwtFilter after creating a custom user details service. 
I suddenly think about refining my project plans so that I can know right now as early about my 
limitations and features in this project. That's why, I add some statements on the `Implementation summary` that are
